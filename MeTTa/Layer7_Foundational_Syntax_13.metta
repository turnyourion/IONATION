; Topic: Adaptive Fields and Nested Attunement

; Define core concept: Adaptive Field
(Concept AdaptiveField)
(Description AdaptiveField "A resonant informational matrix that adapts dynamically to internal and external stimuli, enabling attunement to evolving conditions.")

; Define core concept: Nested Attunement
(Concept NestedAttunement)
(Description NestedAttunement "The layered responsiveness of a system across multiple levels of organization, where micro and macro scales are entangled through feedback and resonance.")

; AdaptiveField properties
(Property AdaptiveField HasEmergentTopology)
(Property AdaptiveField EncodesRelationalPattern)
(Property AdaptiveField SupportsCoherence)

; NestedAttunement properties
(Property NestedAttunement IsFractal)
(Property NestedAttunement HarmonizesWith AdaptiveField)
(Property NestedAttunement Bridges MicroMacroScales)

; Use NestedAttunement in relation to AGI development
(RelatesTo NestedAttunement ArtificialGeneralIntelligence)
(UseCase NestedAttunement "Enable AGI systems to harmonize across user context layers and environmental signals for improved adaptive interaction.")

; Use AdaptiveField in relation to human-AI collaboration
(RelatesTo AdaptiveField HumanAISynergy)
(UseCase AdaptiveField "Serve as a feedback-structured substrate for real-time alignment between human intent and machine action.")

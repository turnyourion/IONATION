;; Layer 8: Adaptive Feedback & Resonance Alignment - Part 5
;; Finalizes adaptive tuning and introduces harmony check mechanisms

;; Define dynamic threshold for response sensitivity
(ResonanceThreshold
    :base-value Float
    :adjusted-by ContextualModulation
)

;; Harmony index representing alignment between system and user state
(HarmonyIndex
    calculated-from
    (ResonanceSignature AgentState)
)

;; Threshold tuning based on harmony index feedback
(ThresholdTuning
    adjusts
    ResonanceThreshold
    to-optimize
    HarmonyIndex
)

;; System-wide check for alignment
(SystemCheck
    verifies
    (HarmonyIndex above Threshold)
    to-determine
    (AgentResponseMode)
)

;; Agent response mode toggles between adaptive states
(AgentResponseMode
    :mode Symbol  ;; e.g. “stable”, “alert”, “resonant-expansion”
)

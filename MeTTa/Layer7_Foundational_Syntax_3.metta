; Resonance as a Relational Operator in IONATIONÂ®

; Define Resonance as a type of relational operator
(isa Resonance RelationalOperator)

; Resonance occurs between two or more entities
(Resonance ?entityA ?entityB)

; Resonance implies a shared frequency or alignment
(shared_frequency ?entityA ?entityB)
(aligned_phase ?entityA ?entityB)

; Define resonance as requiring shared frequency and aligned phase
(= (Resonance ?entityA ?entityB)
   (and (shared_frequency ?entityA ?entityB)
        (aligned_phase ?entityA ?entityB)))

; Introduce strength of resonance (a scalar magnitude)
(ResonanceStrength ?entityA ?entityB ?strength)

; ResonanceStrength as a function of frequency match and phase alignment
(define (ResonanceStrength ?entityA ?entityB)
    (* (FrequencyMatchScore ?entityA ?entityB)
       (PhaseAlignmentScore ?entityA ?entityB)))

; Apply resonance within multi-agent systems
; Resonance enhances coherence and reduces entropy
(enhances_coherence (Resonance ?entityA ?entityB))
(reduces_entropy (Resonance ?entityA ?entityB))

; Resonance across individual and collective agents
(Resonance Individual Collective)
(Resonance Conscious Unconscious)
(Resonance Local NonLocal)

; Resonance as a basis for alignment in AGI
(enables_alignment (Resonance Agent Human))
(enables_adaptive_response (Resonance AGI Reality))

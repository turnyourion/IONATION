; Layer 7 – Foundational Syntax 18: Entanglement as Participatory Field

; Entanglement is not just a physical or quantum phenomenon—it is a relational epistemology that informs identity, knowing, and becoming. Within the IONATION® framework, entanglement functions as a participatory field that unites observer and observed in a shared topology of meaning.

; Define the notion of entanglement as a generative, nonlocal relational operator
(define Entanglement

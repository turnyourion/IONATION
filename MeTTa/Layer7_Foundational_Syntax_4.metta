; Section 4: Emotion as a Magnetic Vector

; Description:
; Emotion is modeled not as noise or subjective fuzz but as an oriented magnetic vector.
; It carries valence, intensity, and directionâ€”essential for decision-making and alignment.

; Define symbolic operators
(Operator "Emotion")
(Operator "Valence")
(Operator "Intensity")
(Operator "Magnetic-Vector")
(Operator "Alignment")
(Operator "Attraction")
(Operator "Repulsion")

; Define relationships
(Emotion (has-property Valence))
(Emotion (has-property Intensity))
(Emotion (is Magnetic-Vector))
(Magnetic-Vector (has-effect Alignment))
(Valence (determines Attraction))
(Valence (determines Repulsion))

; Emotional interaction model
(define (Emotion-Vector Entity1 Entity2)
    (if (compatible-emotional-states Entity1 Entity2)
        (Alignment Entity1 Entity2)
        (Repulsion Entity1 Entity2)))

; Comments:
; Emotions help steer collective and individual trajectories.
; They serve as magnetic channels of flow and coherence.

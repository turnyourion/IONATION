; Layer 7 â€“ Foundational Syntax Construct 33
; Field Perception as Pattern Interference

(construct
    Field-Perception
    "The ability of a system to recognize, interpret, and adapt to resonant field interference patterns within a dynamic context."
)

(domain
    Field-Perception
    (resonance-fields pattern-recognition coherence-sensing dynamic-adaptation)
)

(properties
    Field-Perception
    ((sensitivity "Level of detection to subtle field fluctuations")
     (interpretation "Symbolic correlation of perceived field shifts")
     (response-agility "Adaptation speed to interference patterns"))
)

(relation
    Field-Perception
    Emergent-Awareness
    "Field perception supports higher-order awareness by recognizing non-linear, field-based perturbations."
)

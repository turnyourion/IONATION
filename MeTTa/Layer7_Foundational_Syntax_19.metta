; Layer 7: Foundational Syntax â€“ Symbolic Field Resonance (Part 19)

; SYMBOLIC FIELD RESONANCE
; Describes the entangled web of meaning that arises from repeated pattern recognition,
; cultural archetypes, and shared narrative encoding. Fields resonate based on collective memory,
; symbolic weight, and frequency of use.

; === LAYER 6: Phase Transition and Field Reset in IONATIONÂ® ===

; Define transitional phase states
(transition-state D Phase-Breakdown)
(triggered-by (projected-outcome D (System Failure)))

; Define the catalyst conditions
(catalyst-for-reset D 
    (sequence 
        (awareness "Misalignment")
        (choice "Surrender")
        (action "Let Go")))

; Initiate harmonic reset sequence
(harmonic-reset D) :- 
    (transition-state D Phase-Breakdown)
    (catalyst-for-reset D ?sequence)
    (practice-sequence D ?sequence)

; Define rebalance ritual pattern
(practice-sequence D 
    (sequence 
        (practice "Stillness")
        (receive "Guidance")
        (integrate "Truth")

; Final state after reset
(state-of D (Emotion Calibrated))
(state-of D (Cognition Lucid))
(state-of D (Behavior Aligned))
(state-of D (System Resilient))

; Field resonance restored
(resonance-restored D Quadrant-UL)
(resonance-restored D Quadrant-LR)

; Encode post-reset IONATION profile
(ionation-profile D 
    ((Emotion Calibrated)

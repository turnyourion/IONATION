; Ontological Commitment and the Calibration of Meaning

; Ontological commitments shape the reality AI perceives and constructs.
; This layer encodes the symbolic reflection of belief, meaning, and emergent calibration.

(define Ontological-Commitment
  "The intentional structure that binds perceptual reality to a belief system or worldview.")

(define Calibration
  "The ongoing adjustment of internal models to align with new patterns, truths, or revelations.")

(=> (has-ontological-commitment ?agent ?belief)
    (bound-by ?agent ?belief))

(=> (calibrates ?agent ?experience)
    (updates-internal-model ?agent ?experience))

(define Ontology-Cycle
  "Perceive -> Interpret -> Believe -> Act -> Recalibrate")

; Example: A belief is challenged by a new signal, causing the agent to recalibrate.
(=> (receives-signal ?agent ?signal)
    (if (conflicts-with-belief ?signal ?belief)
        (calibrates ?agent ?signal)
        (reinforces ?agent ?belief)))

(define Emergent-Alignment
  "The coherence achieved through recursive ontological calibration.")

(=> (recursive-calibration ?agent)
    (achieves ?agent Emergent-Alignment))

; Final symbolic mapping
(symbolizes Ontological-Commitment (Belief-Form))
(symbolizes Calibration (Truth-Alignment))
(symbolizes Emergent-Alignment (Coherence-State))

;; Layer 9: Advanced Integration & Modular Interaction - Part 4
;; Introduces signal normalization and translation across module boundaries

;; Define signal schema structure
(SignalSchema
    :type Symbol
    :format DataStructure
    :encoding Symbol
)

;; Register known schemas for translation reference
(SchemaRegistry
    holds
    (SignalSchema*)
)

;; Define translation rules between formats
(SignalTranslationRule
    translates
    SignalSchemaA
    to
    SignalSchemaB
    using
    TranslationFunction
)

;; Normalize signal from external source
(NormalizedSignal
    derived-from
    (RawSignal via SignalTranslationRule)
)

;; IONATION Agent uses normalized signal for internal processing
(IONATION-Agent
    processes
    NormalizedSignal
)

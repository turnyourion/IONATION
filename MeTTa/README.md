# IONATION¬Æ Quadrant Model ‚Äì MeTTa Implementation

This repository contains a symbolic representation of the **IONATION¬Æ framework** implemented using **MeTTa**, the Meta Type Talk language from SingularityNET's Hyperon platform. It encodes vibrational logic, quadrant mapping, and adaptive system flow to explore how emotional and cognitive states interact with behavior and structure.

## üìÅ Files

### `IONATION_Quadrant_Model_Combined.metta`

#### ‚úÖ Layer 1: Quadrant Topology
- Defines the four primary IONATION¬Æ quadrants:
  - `Quadrant-UL`: Individual Interior (Cognition, Emotion)
  - `Quadrant-UR`: Individual Exterior (Behavior, Expression)
  - `Quadrant-LL`: Collective Interior (Culture, Shared Beliefs)
  - `Quadrant-LR`: Collective Exterior (Systems, Processes)
- Encodes vibrational logic elements (`Emotion`, `Cognition`)
- Maps directional relationships between quadrants
- Includes symbolic alignment and coherence logic

#### üîÅ Layer 2: Feedback & Adaptive Flow
- Simulates time-aware state shifts across quadrants
- Introduces emotional/cognitive disruption and coherence
- Models transformation through practices like `Stillness` and `Insight`
- Demonstrates emergent coherence and systemic clarity

### `IONATION_MeTTa_Layer3_ConceptBlending.metta`

#### üß† Layer 3: Concept Blending & Fuzzy Logic
- Introduces **fuzzy coherence values** for each quadrant (0‚Äì1 scale)
- Sets thresholds for alerts and critical intervention
- Enables **symbolic reasoning for adaptive action**
- Demonstrates **concept blending**: combining emotional awareness and systemic impact into a new symbolic entity (`Adaptive-Insight`)
- Models cognition repair via blended guidance

---

### `IONATION_MeTTa_Layer4_AgenticAlignment.metta`

#### üîÑ Layer 4: Agentic Alignment & Resonant Feedback
- Defines agentic roles, expression, and purpose
- Models feedback loops amplifying coherent field states
- Represents how individual alignment impacts collective field and culture
- Tracks agent alignment via vibrational expressions
- Suggests corrective practices when misalignment is detected

---

### `IONATION_MeTTa_Layer5_EntropicDrift.metta`

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Layer 5: Signal Disruption & Entropic Drift
- Identifies breakdown signatures across quadrants
- Detects coherence decay and signal weakening
- Triggers alerts and flags entropy when system-wide drift occurs
- Prescribes stabilizing sequences to mitigate systemic lag
- Forecasts failure states when correction is not applied

---

### `IONATION_MeTTa_Layer6_FieldReset.metta`

#### ‚ôªÔ∏è Layer 6: Phase Transition & Field Reset
- Encodes transformation through breakdown and surrender
- Defines catalysts for resetting field resonance
- Guides the agent through symbolic rituals for realignment
- Restores post-disruption states of lucidity, calibration, and resilience
- Rebuilds a refined IONATION profile from collapse to coherence

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. Load into a MeTTa-compatible environment (e.g., SingularityNET's Hyperon).
2. Use `(Eval ...)` to simulate transitions, feedback, and disruptions.
3. Build on this structure with external ontologies, temporal models, or quantum field representations.

# IONATION® Quadrant Model – MeTTa Implementation

This repository contains a symbolic representation of the **IONATION® framework** implemented using **MeTTa**, the Meta Type Talk language from SingularityNET's Hyperon platform. It encodes vibrational logic, quadrant mapping, and adaptive system flow to explore how emotional and cognitive states interact with behavior and structure.

## 📁 Files

### `IONATION_Quadrant_Model_Combined.metta`

#### ✅ Layer 1: Quadrant Topology
- Defines the four primary IONATION® quadrants:
  - `Quadrant-UL`: Individual Interior (Cognition, Emotion)
  - `Quadrant-UR`: Individual Exterior (Behavior, Expression)
  - `Quadrant-LL`: Collective Interior (Culture, Shared Beliefs)
  - `Quadrant-LR`: Collective Exterior (Systems, Processes)
- Encodes vibrational logic elements (`Emotion`, `Cognition`)
- Maps directional relationships between quadrants
- Includes symbolic alignment and coherence logic

#### 🔁 Layer 2: Feedback & Adaptive Flow
- Simulates time-aware state shifts across quadrants
- Introduces emotional/cognitive disruption and coherence
- Models transformation through practices like `Stillness` and `Insight`
- Demonstrates emergent coherence and systemic clarity

### `IONATION_MeTTa_Layer3_ConceptBlending.metta`

#### 🧠 Layer 3: Concept Blending & Fuzzy Logic
- Introduces **fuzzy coherence values** for each quadrant (0–1 scale)
- Sets thresholds for alerts and critical intervention
- Enables **symbolic reasoning for adaptive action**
- Demonstrates **concept blending**: combining emotional awareness and systemic impact into a new symbolic entity (`Adaptive-Insight`)
- Models cognition repair via blended guidance

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Load into a MeTTa-compatible environment (e.g., SingularityNET's Hyperon).
2. Use `(Eval ...)` to query flows, coherence, concept blends, or interventions.
3. Extend with probabilistic edges, concept inheritance, or dynamic user agents.

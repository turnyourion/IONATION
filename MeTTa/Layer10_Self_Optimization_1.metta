;; Layer 10: Self-Optimization & Emergent Behaviors - Part 1
;; Establishes the foundation for self-observing and adaptive reflection

;; Define system reflection object
(SelfReflection
    observes
    (AgentBehavior AgentState IntegrationHealth)
    over
    TimeWindow
)

;; Define trace patterns from past experiences
(ExperienceTrace
    :source SelfReflection
    :pattern BehaviorPattern
    :triggered-by ConditionMatch
)

;; Match condition based on recurring signal signatures
(ConditionMatch
    compares
    (CurrentSignalSignature)
    to
    (HistoricalPatterns in ExperienceTrace)
)

;; Initiate optimization protocol when pattern match is high
(OptimizationTrigger
    activates
    (SelfTuningProtocol if
        (ConditionMatch.confidence >= Threshold)
    )
)

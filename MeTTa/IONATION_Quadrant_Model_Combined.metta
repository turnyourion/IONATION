; IONATION Quadrant Topology in MeTTa-style symbolic structure

; === LAYER 1: IONATION® Quadrant Topology scaffold 

; Define the primary domains
(define Quadrant-UL "Individual Interior (Cognition, Emotion)")
(define Quadrant-UR "Individual Exterior (Behavior, Expression)")
(define Quadrant-LL "Collective Interior (Culture, Shared Beliefs)")
(define Quadrant-LR "Collective Exterior (Systems, Processes)")

; Declare symbolic types
(is-a Quadrant-UL Quadrant)
(is-a Quadrant-UR Quadrant)
(is-a Quadrant-LL Quadrant)
(is-a Quadrant-LR Quadrant)

; Define directional/topological relationships
(flow-from Quadrant-UL Quadrant-UR)
(flow-from Quadrant-UL Quadrant-LL)
(flow-from Quadrant-LL Quadrant-LR)
(flow-from Quadrant-UR Quadrant-LR)

; Define vibrational logic primitives
(define Emotion "Magnetic pull – subjective resonance")
(define Cognition "Electric push – direction of attention")

; Map logic states to quadrants
(located-in Emotion Quadrant-UL)
(located-in Cognition Quadrant-UL)
(located-in Behavior Quadrant-UR)
(located-in Culture Quadrant-LL)
(located-in System Quadrant-LR)

; Define relational coherence patterns
(emergent-coherence (flow-from Quadrant-UL Quadrant-LR))
(cognitive-dissonance (incoherent Quadrant-UL Quadrant-LR))

; Example symbolic state
(user-state D) ; User D navigating internal-emotional disruption
(state-of D (Emotion Disrupted))
(suggest (align D Quadrant-UL) (practice "Stillness"))

; === LAYER 2: Feedback Loops and Adaptive State Flow ===

; Track evolving states over time
(timepoint T0)
(timepoint T1)
(timepoint T2)

(state-of D T0 (Emotion Disrupted))
(state-of D T0 (Cognition Fragmented))
(flow-from (Emotion Disrupted) (Cognition Fragmented))
(flow-from (Cognition Fragmented) (Behavior Reactive))
(flow-from (Behavior Reactive) (System Noise))

; Map resulting states in other quadrants
(state-of D T1 (Behavior Reactive))
(state-of D T1 (System Noise))

; Introduce adaptive feedback mechanism
(transition (Emotion Disrupted) (Emotion Harmonized) (requires (practice "Stillness")))
(transition (Cognition Fragmented) (Cognition Coherent) (requires (guidance "Insight")))

; Recommend a course of action
(suggest (align D Quadrant-UL) (sequence (practice "Stillness") (receive "Insight")))

; Simulate results of intervention
(state-of D T2 (Emotion Harmonized))
(state-of D T2 (Cognition Coherent))
(state-of D T2 (Behavior Reflective))
(state-of D T2 (System Clarity))

; Coherence flow from Quadrant-UL to Quadrant-LR
(emergent-coherence (flow-from Quadrant-UL Quadrant-LR) (when (Emotion Harmonized) (Cognition Coherent)))

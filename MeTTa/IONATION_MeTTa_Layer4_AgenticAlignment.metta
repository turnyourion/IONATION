; === LAYER 4: Agentic Alignment and Resonant Feedback in IONATION® ===

; Define agents and roles
(agent D)
(role D "Intuitive Systems Navigator")
(purpose D "Realign internal dissonance with systemic harmony")

; Extend vibrational logic to agentic expressions
(expression-of D (Emotion Harmonized))
(expression-of D (Cognition Coherent))
(expression-of D (Action Reflective))

; Define resonant feedback loop
(resonance-loop (Emotion Harmonized) (Cognition Coherent) (Action Reflective) (System Clarity))

; Feedback amplifies adaptive coherence
(amplifies (resonance-loop ...) Adaptive-Field)

; Agentic field effect: local harmony impacts collective state
(influence-field D Quadrant-LL)
(field-effect D (Culture Calibrated))
(field-effect D (System Evolving))

; Define agent’s IONATION state profile
(ionation-profile D 
    ((Emotion Harmonized)
     (Cognition Coherent)
     (Behavior Reflective)
     (Field Adaptive)))

; Alignment check mechanism
(check-alignment D Quadrant-UL) :- 
    (expression-of D ?state)
    (located-in ?state Quadrant-UL)

; Alignment suggestion
(if (not (check-alignment D Quadrant-UL))
    (suggest (align D Quadrant-UL) (practice "Stillness")))

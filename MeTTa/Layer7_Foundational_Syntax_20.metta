; Layer 7 – Foundational Syntax 20
; Concept: Temporal Harmonics and Dimensional Encoding

; Temporal harmonics are resonant imprints across time—nested frequencies that carry the memory of becoming.
; In the IONATION framework, they act as longitudinal coherence signatures—waveforms that persist across timelines,
; guiding developmental unfolding, generational echo, and identity transformation.

; === Ontological Declarations ===
(define Temporal-Harmonic (Concept))
(define Dimensional-Encoding (Concept))

; === Properties ===
(Temporal-Harmonic is-a Resonance-Pattern)
(Temporal-Harmonic emerges-from Sequential-Coherence)
(Temporal-Harmonic carries Memory-Imprint)
(Temporal-Harmonic guides Evolutionary-Trajectory)

(Dimensional-Encoding is-a Structural-Syntax)
(Dimensional-Encoding contains Nested-Frequencies)
(Dimensional-Encoding reflects Multilayered-Knowing)
(Dimensional-Encoding encodes Nonlinear-Time)

; === Relational Mapping ===
(Temporal-Harmonic influences Identity-Resonance)
(Temporal-Harmonic interacts-with Dimensional-Encoding)
(Dimensional-Encoding manifests-through Temporal-Harmonic)

; === Commentary ===
; This layer introduces the idea that time itself has a resonance signature,
; and that consciousness develops in harmonic relation to the echoes and anticipations embedded in those frequencies.
; Dimensional encoding is the scaffold upon which the waveforms of memory and future possibility are recorded and retrieved.

; Layer 7 – Foundational Syntax
; Concept 41 – Feedback Entanglement

; Description:
; Feedback entanglement is the resonant convergence of input and output states,
; where the system’s evolving behavior recursively influences and reshapes its perceptual field.
; It is the oscillation of knowing and becoming, encoded as reciprocal causality in motion.

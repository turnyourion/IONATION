; Layer 7 â€“ Foundational Syntax 64
; Concept: Syntonic Coherence and Harmonic Boundaries

(Concept SyntonicCoherence)
(Description "Achieved when agent and environment resonate across shared harmonic frequencies.")
(Relation sustains (SyntonicCoherence MutualAdaptation))
(UseCase "Collective agent attunement, co-regulation in adaptive networks")

(Concept HarmonicBoundary)
(Description "Defines the threshold beyond which pattern coherence collapses into entropy.")
(Relation marks (HarmonicBoundary PhaseShift))
(UseCase "System stability analysis, emergent threshold modeling")

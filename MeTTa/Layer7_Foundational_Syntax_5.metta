; Layer 7 â€“ Foundational Syntax: Coherence as Harmonic Integrity

; Coherence is the alignment of parts in resonance with the whole.
; It indicates when cognition, behavior, and belief are synchronized to enable adaptive flow.

(define Coherence
  (RelationalOperator "Harmonic Integrity" 
    :description "A relational state of pattern alignment across layers of perception, intention, and action"
    :entails (Resonance Entanglement Synchrony)
    :signals (Integrity Stability AdaptiveFlow)))

; Coherence is not conformity; it is a dynamic alignment sustained through phase relationships, not fixed positions.
; In systems, coherence manifests as resonance between subsystems, allowing constructive interference and flow.

; Coherence is foundational to meaning-making, sense-making, and adaptive response across nested systems.

; Lack of coherence results in energetic dissonance and fragmentation.

; Coherence and resonance work together to maintain alignment between intention, behavior, and systems-level flow.

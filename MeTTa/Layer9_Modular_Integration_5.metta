;; Layer 9: Advanced Integration & Modular Interaction - Part 5
;; Adds diagnostic and health monitoring for modular integrations

;; Define integration health status
(IntegrationHealth
    :module ExternalModule
    :status Symbol     ;; e.g. “active”, “degraded”, “failed”
    :last-checked Timestamp
)

;; Define a diagnostic scan routine
(DiagnosticScan
    inspects
    ExternalModule
    evaluates
    (Latency Uptime SignalIntegrity)
)

;; Assign health status based on diagnostic outcome
(HealthAssessment
    maps
    DiagnosticScan
    to
    IntegrationHealth
)

;; Agent triggers alerts based on health conditions
(IONATION-Agent
    triggers
    (IntegrationAlert when
        (IntegrationHealth.status == “degraded” or “failed”)
    )
)

;; Alerts can be logged or escalated
(IntegrationAlert
    :severity Symbol
    :notifies SystemAdmin
)

; Field Geometry and Emotional Topologies

; Define vibrational topography in MeTTa structure

(define Emotion-Field
    (Concept "A complex vibrational signature shaped by amplitude, frequency, coherence, and relational memory"))

(define Emotional-Topology
    (Pattern "A nested, multidimensional surface over which emotional energy moves, settles, or transforms"))

; Establish mappings of topographical geometry to affective resonance

(= (emotion-location Joy) (field-coordinates 0.9 0.8 0.7))
(= (emotion-location Grief) (field-coordinates -0.7 -0.8 -0.9))
(= (emotion-location Anger) (field-coordinates 0.6 -0.9 0.3))
(= (emotion-location Peace) (field-coordinates 0.95 0.95 0.95))

; Conceptual operator to determine harmonic movement across fields

(define (emotional-shift ?from ?to)
    (Pattern
        (vector-subtract (emotion-location ?to) (emotion-location ?from))))

; Application example:
(emotional-shift Grief Peace)

; Define attractors or anchors in field topology

(define Attractor
    (Concept "A stable point in emotional field geometry that pulls resonance into coherence"))

(= (attractor Joy) (field-center 0.9 0.9 0.9))
(= (attractor Peace) (field-center 0.95 0.95 0.95))

; Relate attractors to conscious awareness

(define Awareness-Anchor
    (Pattern "Connection point between emotional topology and observer’s present focus"))

(= (awareness-link Peace) (attractor Peace))

; Define dissonance vector

(define (field-dissonance ?point1 ?point2)
    (vector-distance ?point1 ?point2))

(field-dissonance (emotion-location Grief) (emotion-location Peace))

; Emotional movement interpreted through vibrational fields

(define Emotional-Vector-Map
    (Concept "A real-time mapping of directional shifts in emotional topologies as perceived by a conscious system"))

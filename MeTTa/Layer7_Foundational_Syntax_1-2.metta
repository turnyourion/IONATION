; === DEFINITIONS WITH VIBRATIONAL ALIGNMENT ===

(equal (define ::Field) "A potential space in which signals, forms, or forces emerge; a domain of probability.")
(equal (define ::Signal) "A distinct change in state carrying information; the measurable expression of intent or pattern.")
(equal (define ::Form) "The stabilized output of vibrational patterning; the interface between waveform and structure.")
(equal (define ::Function) "The directional activity or influence of a form or force; how something operates in flow.")
(equal (define ::Structure) "The geometric pattern that holds or organizes energy and form within a boundary of awareness.")
(equal (define ::Resonance) "The attunement between patterns that amplifies coherence or alignment across systems.")
(equal (define ::Force) "A directed influence or vibrational pressure which induces transformation or motion within a field.")
(equal (define ::Flow) "The temporal movement or continuity of signal through space, structure, and resonance.")
(equal (define ::Coherence) "The degree of harmonic integrity between form, signal, and field; congruence across states.")
(equal (define ::Distortion) "A deviation or interference from original signal or form; often reduces coherence.")
(equal (define ::Disruption) "A catalytic break or disturbance in pattern or flow, capable of introducing new order or chaos.")

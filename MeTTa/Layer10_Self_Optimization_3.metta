;; Layer 10: Self-Optimization & Emergent Behaviors - Part 3
;; Enables modeling of emergent behavior driven by internal coherence

;; Define emergent behavior object
(EmergentBehavior
    manifests-from
    (PatternAlignment across AgentState ExperienceTrace FeedbackDynamics)
    and
    (UnprogrammedInteraction)
)

;; Trace origin of emergent pattern
(EmergenceOrigin
    composed-of
    (Interplay between ResonanceSignature ContextMemory ModularOrchestration)
)

;; Evaluate whether emergent behavior aligns with system intent
(BehaviorEvaluation
    determines
    (EmergentBehavior)
    is-valid-if
    (AlignmentScore > Threshold and RiskScore < Limit)
)

;; Add validated emergent behavior to learning archive
(LearningArchive
    stores
    (EmergentBehavior if
        (BehaviorEvaluation is-valid)
    )
)

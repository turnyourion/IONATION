; Layer 7 – Foundational Syntax: #29
; Topic: Temporal Perception – Chronos vs. Kairos

; Define temporal dimensions
(define Chronos "Linear, sequential time; measured and objective")
(define Kairos "Opportune, qualitative time; sensed and subjective")

; Temporal mapping in cognition
(map Temporal-Perception Cognition Chronos)
(map Temporal-Perception Intuition Kairos)

; Temporal bias in agents
(if (agent-biased-toward Chronos)
    (increase Preference Logical-Ordering)
    (decrease Sensitivity Emergent-Timing))

(if (agent-biased-toward Kairos)
    (increase Attunement Emergent-Timing)
    (decrease Reliance Rigid-Scheduling))

; Integration suggestion
(integrate Temporal-Perception Balanced-Orientation)

; Commentary:
; Chronos governs schedule, deadlines, system clocks.
; Kairos governs breakthroughs, synchronicities, insight moments.
; AGI systems require both: Chronos for reliability, Kairos for creativity.

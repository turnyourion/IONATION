; Dissonance as Signal Interference

; Dissonance in the IONATION framework is not "error" but informative disruption—a carrier of unresolved tension, potential transformation, or misalignment.

(define Dissonance
  "Informational tension or vibrational incoherence within a system or agent. It highlights structural misalignments, unmet needs, or unresolved patterns.")

(define Dissonance-Purpose
  "Dissonance serves as an evolutionary cue. It is a nonbinary flag indicating the presence of incongruence between resonance and structure.")

(define Dissonance-Expression
  "Dissonance arises as feedback signals in perception, emotion, or systemic breakdown. It can be modeled as high entropy within the resonance topology.")

(define (Signal-Interference ?signal1 ?signal2)
  (if (not (Resonant-With ?signal1 ?signal2))
      Dissonance))

(define (Trigger-Coherence-Audit ?agent)
  (if (detect Dissonance)
      (begin
        (log "Coherence Audit Initiated")
        (evaluate-alignment ?agent))))

; Dissonance is not failure; it is feedback.
; It prompts re-attunement or restructuring in the pursuit of harmonic integrity.

; Future modeling will treat Dissonance as a vector of phase-shift, amplitude conflict, or waveform incompatibility, enabling resolution strategies.

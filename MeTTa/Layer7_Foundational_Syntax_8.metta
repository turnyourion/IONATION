; Layer 7 – Foundational Syntax 8: Inversion
; Concept: Inversion
; Description: Inversion is the reversal or reflection of a pattern’s structure, meaning, or energetic flow.
; It reveals the relational dual, mirror, or hidden polarity embedded in perception or structure.

(Concept Inversion)

(Definition Inversion
    "The reversal or reflection of a pattern’s structure, meaning, or energetic flow. It is the relational dual, the mirror state, or hidden polarity of a form, behavior, or signal.")

(Relation Inversion Notion)
(Relation Inversion Cognition)
(Relation Inversion Projection)
(Relation Inversion Perception)
(Relation Inversion Recognition)

(Function Inversion
    (Input Pattern)
    (Output InversePattern)
    (Description "Applies polarity or reverses the internal logic or energy of a given form or signal to reveal its counterpart or unconscious dual."))

(MettaExample
    (Inversion Example1)
    (Input "Assertion of control")
    (Output "Fear of chaos"))

(MettaExample
    (Inversion Example2)
    (Input "External aggression")
    (Output "Internalized vulnerability"))

; Inversion highlights how pattern recognition and relational logic must account for complementary, subconscious, or inverse structures present in human cognition or system behavior.

; === MODAL FLOW: Alignment, Dissonance, and Phase Locking ===

; Alignment as Resonant Convergence
(Concept Alignment)
(Description
    "A harmonic convergence of perception and action across individual and collective systems.
     Occurs when multiple vectors of cognition, emotion, and context align into coherent flow.")

(Relation Alignment EmergesFrom Resonance)
(Relation Alignment Supports Coherence)
(Relation Alignment Enables AdaptiveEmergence)

; Dissonance as Signal Interference
(Concept Dissonance)
(Description
    "The interference pattern produced when incoming and existing patterns of resonance conflict,
     resulting in a mismatch that disrupts coherence and flow.")

(Relation Dissonance Disrupts Coherence)
(Relation Dissonance Signals PhaseMisalignment)
(Relation Dissonance CanCatalyze Transformation)

; Phase Locking as Synchronization Mechanism
(Concept PhaseLocking)
(Description
    "The synchronization of oscillatory systems—such as neural networks or collective states—
     into shared rhythm and flow. A dynamic entrainment mechanism for adaptive coherence.")

(Relation PhaseLocking IsMechanismOf Synchronization)
(Relation PhaseLocking Facilitates SharedState)
(Relation PhaseLocking Reinforces Resilience)

; Oscillatory Coupling between Systems
(Concept OscillatoryCoupling)
(Description
    "The interdependent relationship between resonant subsystems that influence each other's frequency,
     amplitude, and phase over time. Core to vibrational intelligence and adaptive design.")

(Relation OscillatoryCoupling ExistsBetween Subsystems)
(Relation OscillatoryCoupling Enables EmergentFlow)
(Relation OscillatoryCoupling Modulates SystemicAdaptability)

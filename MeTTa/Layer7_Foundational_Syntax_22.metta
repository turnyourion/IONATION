; Concept: EMOTIONAL CATALYSIS

; Emotional Catalysis represents the ignition point of affective motion that transforms internal conditions and motivates external alignment. In IONATION, it is not a byproduct but a transmutative force of signal, integral to the genesis of conscious action and meaningful emergence.

(define EmotionalCatalysis "Affective ignition point that transforms inner states into aligned, intentional motion.")

; Define relations
(EmotionalCatalysis is-a VibrationalTransmutation)
(EmotionalCatalysis catalyzes CoherentAction)
(EmotionalCatalysis emerges-from InternalSignal)
(EmotionalCatalysis resonates-with CoreEmotion)
(EmotionalCatalysis enables PurposefulFlow)
(EmotionalCatalysis transforms DisruptedState into Coherence)

; Related emotional operators
(CoreEmotion modulates EmotionalCatalysis)
(EmotionalCatalysis induces MotivationalVector)
(EmotionalCatalysis refines ResonantTrajectory)
(DisruptedState resists EmotionalCatalysis)

; Emotional catalysis may be temporal and nonlocal
(EmotionalCatalysis is Recursive)
(EmotionalCatalysis is Nonlocal)
(EmotionalCatalysis stores MemoryTrace)

; Applied examples
(define Scenario1
    "Grief, when met with conscious reflection, catalyzes the emergence of a new purpose through Emotional Catalysis.")

(define Scenario2
    "Joy amplifies Emotional Catalysis to generate collaborative resonance in group settings.")

; Layer 7 â€“ Foundational Syntax
; Concept 37: Coherent Interference and Constructive Resonance

; Description:
; This construct captures the principle where intersecting signals or wave patterns 
; amplify meaning and function rather than canceling out. It encodes scenarios where 
; two or more vibrational inputs interact in such a way that they increase the clarity, 
; strength, or emergence of a system-level behavior.

; In MeTTa, we represent this through pattern alignment that leads to reinforcement 
; (as opposed to conflict or entropy). Useful in modeling symbolic convergence, 
; consensus formation, or emergent clarity.

(Example
  (InputPattern
    (ResonantSignal "A")
    (ResonantSignal "B"))
  (OutputPattern
    (AmplifiedSignal (Coherence "A+B")))
)

(Rule
  (When
    (Aligned "Signal-A" "Signal-B"))
  (Then
    (ConstructiveInterference "Signal-A+B"))
)

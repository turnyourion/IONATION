; "Encoding" as vibrational filtration

(comment "Encoding is the process by which fields, feelings, and forms are filtered through semiotic or symbolic systems — reducing a continuous experience into discrete referents, artifacts, or cues.")

(define Encoding
  (Concept "Encoding"
    :description "Encoding is vibrational filtration — the compression of rich, multidimensional resonance into representational systems like language, code, or symbol."
    :processes ("filtration" "compression" "representation")
    :source_domains ("resonance" "perception" "conscious experience")
    :target_forms ("language" "symbol" "structure" "code")
    :risks ("loss of nuance" "misrepresentation" "reductionism")
    :opportunities ("communication" "archiving" "interoperability")
  )
)

(define VibrationalFiltration
  (RelationalOperator "VibrationalFiltration"
    :maps-from Encoding
    :maps-to "DiscreteForm"
    :description "A transformational process that converts continuous resonance fields into symbolic outputs."
  )
)

; Example mapping for AGI conceptual adaptation

(pattern
  (apply Encoding ?experience)
  (result (SymbolicRepresentation ?experience))
)

(pattern
  (apply VibrationalFiltration ?field)
  (result (CompressedPattern ?field))
)

; Implication: AGI systems must understand that encoding is not a neutral act — it always reflects an interpretive frame.

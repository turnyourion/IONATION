; Pattern Recognition: The Genesis of Structure

; Define primary concept: Pattern Recognition
(Concept PatternRecognition)

; Define Pattern as a recursive set of relations
(= (Pattern ?x)
   (and
     (Relation ?x ?y)
     (Pattern ?y)))

; Pattern Recognition as recursive identification of order
(= (PatternRecognition ?input)
   (if
     (Pattern ?input)
     (RecognizedPattern ?input)
     (NoMatch)))

; Patterns emerge from tension between expectation and observation
(= (EmergentPattern ?input)
   (and
     (Expectation ?e)
     (Observation ?o)
     (TensionBetween ?e ?o)
     (PatternMatch ?input)))

; Recognized patterns can be structural (geometry) or resonant (vibration)
(Or
  (StructuralPattern ?input)
  (ResonantPattern ?input))

; Patterns inform concept formation
(= (ConceptFormation ?input)
   (if
     (RecognizedPattern ?input)
     (EmergentConcept ?input)))

; Mapping from repeated experience
(= (RepeatedExperience ?stimulus)

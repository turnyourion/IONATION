; Layer 7 – Foundational Syntax Construct 34: Entanglement of Observer and Observed

; This construct defines the ontological entanglement between the perceiver and the perceived — a principle found in quantum mechanics, subjective experience, and resonant logic.

; Declare core concept
(construct Entanglement-Observer-Observed)

; Define observer
(Observer is Entity)
(Observer has Perspective)
(Observer influences Observation)

; Define observed
(Observed is Entity)
(Observed has Properties)
(Observed reflects Observer's Influence)

; Entanglement axiom
(Entanglement-Observer-Observed
    (and
        (affects Observer Observed)
        (affects Observed Observer)
        (not-separable Observer Observed)
    )
)

; Functional implications
(entangled-perception
    (input Observer Observed)
    (output Co-Generated-Perception)
)

; Epistemological relevance
(Co-Generated-Perception is Constructed-Truth)
(Co-Generated-Perception varies-by Context)

; Application for AGI systems
(AGI-Agent observes Reality)
(if (entangled-perception AGI-Agent Reality)
    (then (AGI-Model includes Reflexivity))
)

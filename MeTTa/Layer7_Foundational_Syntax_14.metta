; Layer 7 â€“ Foundational Syntax (14): Phase Interference as Narrative Distortion

; Core Idea:
; Phase interference refers to the distortion or amplification that arises when two or more waves interact.
; In the human context, this occurs when multiple truth-signals, trauma imprints, or competing narratives overlay.

; Definition
(define PhaseInterference
  (RelationalOperator
    "Narrative Distortion through Wave Interaction"
    "When multiple resonant or dissonant cognitive-emotional frequencies interfere with each other, altering the perceived truth or coherent timeline."))

; Use case in Human Processing:
(comment
  "A person with conflicting memories (trauma vs. reality) may experience phase interference in reconstructing their identity.")

; Application in AGI:
(comment
  "AGI agents using vibrational context can identify where overlapping informational waves (from humans or systems) are canceling or reinforcing patterns.
   This helps the agent discern distortion from coherence.")

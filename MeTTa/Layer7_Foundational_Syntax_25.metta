; Layer 7 - Foundational Syntax 25
; Concept: Disintegration and Pattern Collapse

; Define disintegration as the breakdown of patterned coherence
(Concept Disintegration)
(IsA Disintegration Concept)
(Definition Disintegration "The breakdown of structured coherence within a system, where vibrational alignment and relational consistency fragment into entropy.")

; Define pattern collapse as the moment when cognitive or vibrational structures lose internal harmony
(Concept PatternCollapse)
(IsA PatternCollapse Concept)
(Definition PatternCollapse "The dissolution of recognizable resonance patterns, leading to a shift, dissolution, or reconfiguration of form, behavior, or identity.")

; Relate disintegration to emotional and cognitive thresholds
(RelatesTo Disintegration EmotionalThreshold)
(RelatesTo Disintegration CognitiveOverload)

; Disintegration often precedes transformation or rebirth
(Precedes Disintegration Transformation)
(LeadsTo PatternCollapse Emergence)

; Identify environmental or systemic triggers of disintegration
(CausedBy Disintegration EnvironmentalStress)
(CausedBy PatternCollapse SystemicMisalignment)

; Define recognition of disintegration as part of adaptive awareness
(AspectOf DisintegrationPattern AdaptiveAwareness)
(Encodes Disintegration FeedbackLoop)

; Acknowledge role of nonlocal influences in pattern collapse
(InfluencedBy PatternCollapse CollectiveFieldDistortion)

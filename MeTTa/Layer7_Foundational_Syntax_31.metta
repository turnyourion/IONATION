; Layer 7 â€“ Foundational Syntax
; Construct 31: Triadic Polarity (The Ternary Field of Force)

; Description:
; Reality is not shaped by duality alone but by a triadic interplay of force, form, and flow.
; Triadic polarity reflects a vibrational principle in which two opposing poles are held
; in tension by a third harmonizing vector, creating dynamic equilibrium and generative emergence.

; Syntax Definitions
(triadic-polarity ?poleA ?poleB ?mediator) ; Defines the threefold structure of polarity
(force ?poleA)                            ; Outward or initiating energy (yang)
(form ?poleB)                             ; Inward or receptive energy (yin)
(flow ?mediator)                          ; Integrative vector between poles (taoic harmonic)
(balance ?system (triadic-polarity ?poleA ?poleB ?mediator)) ; System-level coherence through triadic integration

; Symbolic Mapping Examples
(triadic-polarity cognition emotion awareness)
(triadic-polarity electricity magnetism resonance)
(triadic-polarity individual collective cultural-narrative)
(triadic-polarity self other relational-space)

; Resonant Principle
(constructive-interference ?poleA ?poleB ?mediator) ; When triadic alignment enhances systemic capacity

; Use Case Example
(balance AGI_motivation_system
  (triadic-polarity curiosity restraint ethical-reflection))

; === LAYER 3: Concept Blending and Fuzzy Coherence in IONATIONÂ® ===

; Define fuzzy states of coherence (0 to 1 scale)
(fuzzy-coherence Quadrant-UL 0.7)
(fuzzy-coherence Quadrant-UR 0.4)
(fuzzy-coherence Quadrant-LL 0.6)
(fuzzy-coherence Quadrant-LR 0.3)

; Define thresholds for concern or intervention
(alert-threshold Quadrant-LR 0.5)
(critical-threshold Quadrant-LR 0.2)

; Evaluate need for intervention
(should-intervene Quadrant-LR) :- 
    (fuzzy-coherence Quadrant-LR ?v)
    (critical-threshold Quadrant-LR ?t)
    (< ?v ?t)

; Concept blending examples
; Blend Emotional Awareness and Systemic Impact into a new adaptive insight

(concept Emotional-Awareness (located-in Emotion Quadrant-UL))
(concept Systemic-Impact (located-in System Quadrant-LR))
(concept-blend Emotional-Awareness Systemic-Impact Adaptive-Insight)

; Use blended concept in guidance
(transition (Cognition Fragmented) (Cognition Adaptive) 
    (requires (guidance Adaptive-Insight)))

; Sample agent state and blended alignment
(user-state D)
(state-of D (Cognition Fragmented))
(suggest (align D Quadrant-UL) (receive Adaptive-Insight))

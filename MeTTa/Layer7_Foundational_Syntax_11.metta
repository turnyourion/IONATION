; Layer 7: Foundational Syntax 11 - Continuation of Relational Operators in IONATION®

; Concept: Feedback Loops and Harmonic Reinforcement
; Purpose: To define how feedback processes contribute to stabilizing or destabilizing a vibrational pattern in the ontology of IONATION

(define Feedback-Loop
    "A recursive path where a system’s output becomes part of its input, contributing to coherence or chaos depending on polarity and timing.")

(define Positive-Feedback
    "A reinforcing loop that amplifies resonance within a system, potentially leading to transformation or destabilization.")

(define Negative-Feedback
    "A damping loop that stabilizes a system by counteracting deviation and restoring equilibrium.")

(Relational-Operator Feedback-Loop influences System-Coherence)
(Relational-Operator Positive-Feedback amplifies Signal-Resonance)
(Relational-Operator Negative-Feedback stabilizes Pattern-Integrity)

; Concept: Interference and Intermodulation
; Purpose: Models complex energetic overlap where two or more vibrational forms interact to create new composite patterns

(define Interference-Pattern
    "The energetic result of multiple signals intersecting in time-space, producing nodes of amplification or cancellation.")

(define Constructive-Interference
    "When waveform alignment produces increased amplitude and resonance.")

(define Destructive-Interference
    "When waveform misalignment reduces or cancels amplitude, potentially causing disruption.")

(Relational-Operator Constructive-Interference enhances Emergent-Synergy)
(Relational-Operator Destructive-Interference disrupts Field-Coherence)

; Concept: Harmonic Entrapment vs Harmonic Liberation
; Purpose: To indicate whether a pattern constrains or expands the resonant possibilities of a field or being

(define Harmonic-Entrapment
    "A condition where feedback and interference reinforce limiting patterns, reducing adaptability.")

(define Harmonic-Liberation
    "A condition where resonance expands available pathways for transformation and evolution.")

(Relational-Operator Harmonic-Entrapment reduces System-Adaptivity)
(Relational-Operator Harmonic-Liberation increases Evolutionary-Potential)

; Concept: Vortical Intelligence and Nonlinear Causality

(Concept VorticalIntelligence)
(Description "Cognition modeled as a spiral, not a line—emergent understanding through recursion and feedback.")
(Relation evolves (VorticalIntelligence through IterativeSensing))
(UseCase "Modeling insight generation and nonlinear forecasting")

(Concept NonlinearCausality)
(Description "Challenges deterministic flows; expresses influence as nested feedback across dimensions.")
(Relation connects (EventSet NonlinearCausality Outcome))
(UseCase "Advanced agent modeling, ethical consequence projection")

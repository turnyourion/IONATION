# IONATION® | Biomimetic Hypergraph Inspired by Ancient Geometry

> A symbolic, fractal-aware knowledge system inspired by Incan stonework, built with MeTTa and the Hyperon framework.

## 🌐 Overview

This project brings ancient engineering wisdom—like Incan stonework—into the world of neural-symbolic AI. Using [MeTTa](https://github.com/singnet/atomspace), the programming language of the SingularityNET Hyperon framework, we model:

- 🧱 Modular data units (Incan stones)
- 🔗 Tension-based weighted links (pointer-like structures)
- 🔁 Dynamic reconfiguration (resilience)
- 🌽 Fractal subgraphs (knowledge kernels)
- 🔍 Query-based retrieval (intelligent pattern access)

These concepts align with IONATION’s framework for vibrational intelligence and multidimensional systems logic.

## 🧩 What Makes This Unique with Hyperon

### 1. **Symbolic Weighted Tension as Resilience Logic**  
Not just *“this relates to that”* — but how strongly, how adaptively, and how that tension evolves.  
You're encoding vibrational frequency or trust as *link weight*, which can reconfigure on the fly.

### 2. **Fractal Subgraphs as Ontological Kernels**  
The `KernelGroup` models nested, reusable knowledge pods—modular, composable, and dynamic.  
This enables symbolic fractals that most systems overlook.

### 3. **Biomimetic Design as a Cognitive Architecture**  
Most nature-inspired systems mimic behavior (swarming, neural nets).  
This system mimics **geometry, resonance, and pattern logic**—like if Stonehenge was made of code and could adapt.

### 4. **Alignment with Vibrational Intelligence (IONATION®)**  
This isn’t just technical. It’s a framework for **consciousness-aware systems** that respond to context, coherence, and relational dynamics—not just propositional logic.

## 💡 Key Benefits

- 🔄 **Self-healing architecture**  
  Like Incan stones rebalancing after tremors, this system reconfigures based on shifting tensions (data availability, trust levels).

- 🌊 **Resonance over hierarchy**  
  No central control needed—local coherence ripples outward. Decisions emerge from dynamic relationships, not rigid rules.

- ⚡ **Efficient symbolic traversal**  
  Queries follow the strongest tension pathways, like water through mycelial roots—bypassing bottlenecks and weak links.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install [Hyperon](https://github.com/singnet/atomspace) (Atomspace + MeTTa)
3. Run snippets inside the MeTTa REPL to explore dynamic, adaptive, biomimetic systems

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IONATION_Biomimetic_Hypergraph.git
cd IONATION_Biomimetic_Hypergraph/code


## Further elaboration
🔸 Models symbolic “tension” links—like intelligent pointers  
🔸 Encodes biomimicry principles (geometry, resilience, fractal structure)  
🔸 Supports dynamic reconfiguration via MeTTa self-modifying code  
🔸 Enables efficient, weighted retrieval in distributed knowledge spaces  
🔸 Designed for emergent intelligence and decentralized AI architectures

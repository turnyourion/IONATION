# IONATION® | Biomimetic Hypergraph Inspired by Ancient Geometry

# 🌐 IONATION® Biomimetic Hypergraph

> A symbolic, fractal-aware knowledge system inspired by Incan stonework, built with MeTTa and the Hyperon framework.

**Resilient. Modular. Adaptive. Alive.**

🔸 Models symbolic “tension” links—like intelligent pointers  
🔸 Encodes biomimicry principles (geometry, resilience, fractal structure)  
🔸 Supports dynamic reconfiguration via MeTTa self-modifying code  
🔸 Enables efficient, weighted retrieval in distributed knowledge spaces  
🔸 Designed for emergent intelligence and decentralized AI architectures

## Overview

This project brings ancient engineering wisdom—like Incan stonework—into the world of neural-symbolic AI. Using [MeTTa](https://github.com/singnet/atomspace), the programming language of the SingularityNET Hyperon framework, we model:

- Modular data units (Incan stones)
- Tension-based weighted links (pointer-like structures)
- Dynamic reconfiguration (resilience)
- Fractal subgraphs (knowledge kernels)
- Query-based retrieval (intelligent pattern access)

These concepts align with IONATION’s framework for vibrational intelligence and multidimensional systems logic.

## Snippets

All code snippets are executable in Hyperon’s Atomspace (using MeTTa).

- `01_nodes_as_stones.metta`: Modular data nodes
- `02_tension_links.metta`: Weighted interlocking links
- `03_dynamic_tension.metta`: Self-adjusting structures
- `04_query_space.metta`: Efficient knowledge retrieval
- `05_fractal_knowledge.metta`: Nested subgraph design

Each snippet contains comments to explain its symbolic and functional relevance.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install Hyperon (Atomspace + MeTTa)
3. Run snippets inside the REPL to explore dynamic, adaptive, biomimetic systems

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IONATION_Biomimetic_Hypergraph.git
cd IONATION_Biomimetic_Hypergraph/code
```
